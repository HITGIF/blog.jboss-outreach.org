It has been a week since I participated in Google Code-In as a 11th-grade, and I have to say that **THIS IS AWESOME**.

I encountered coding at about 7th grade and was highly impressed by the amaze of making dead things alive with simple instructions. Til now I’ve made some little progress on a handful small projects built for myself, yet contributing to the open source world and collaborating with other devs is something I never did before until I get to know GCI by a lucky chance, and that is full of fun and **EXCITEMENT**.

It has been a great time working with JBoss Community which is actually the most popular org in GCI currently XD. Competing with other passionate contestants while working with them at the same time is really challenging yet fascinating. Even though there’re some technologies I’m not good at or haven’t encountered before, contributing to the construction of those project with what I know and what I’m capable of gives me unprecedented satisfactions.

**Wish I have a good time seeing billions of my tasks got approved XD.**
