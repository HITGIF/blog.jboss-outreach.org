I have just attended a webinar by the Red Hat JBoss Community on the topic,  **Transitioning From Traditional to Cloud-Creative Development With `Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes`**. The link was [here](https://onlinexperiences.com/Launch/Event.htm?ShowKey=46769).

### Who Was It From
This webinar was given by *Syed Rasheed*, the Solution Marketing Manager of Red Hat.

### What Is RHOAR
During the presentation, Rasheed introduced the `Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes` (RHOAR), which is a collection of **cloud-native** runtimes for developing Java or JavaScript applications on `OpenShift`.

It provides portability across multiple cloud infrastructures, allowing the developer to use microservices, containers, and DevOps automation.

### What Did I Learn
Traditionally, the Monolith Java EE Lifecycle is three months. That basically means that it usually takes up to **three months** for a simple change in Java or JavaScript Apps to be deployed on a cloud platform.

That is like, if you changed a single line of your App, and you want all the users to get an update, that takes 3 months.

However, with RHOAR, companies can build and deploy all the Java or JavaScript Apps on OpenShift with the simpler development process, flexible strategic as well as the automation from development to deployment that provide speed with standardization.

Moreover, RHOAR allows the developers to use microservices to speed up the software release cycles, which are compatible with numerous Java runtimes including JBoss EAP, Vert.X, WildFly Swarm, Node.js, Tomcat and so on.

Therefore, with the help of Red Hat OpenShift Application Runtimes, the App release cycle can be optimized from 3  months down to 16 minutes. As Rasheed concludes, *"The cloud software deployment is approaching a zero-day event."*

### Overall,
The whole concept of Cloud Native Development and Application Runtimes was actually quite strange to me as I had never encountered such terminology before.

Though attending this webinar, I'm able to gain a basic understanding of what is going on in the process of deploying a Java or JavaScript App, how it used to be sophisticated and what can Red Hat do with RHOAR to help greatly improve that.

In general, I am glad and thankful for being able to attend such an event for the first time of my life, which indeed expanded my knowledge.
